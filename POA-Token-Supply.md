#### Initial Supply
POA's initial token supply when Core network was launched was `252,460,800` POA. As you can see from the chart on the right, only 70% of POA was reserved for presale and the rest were reserved for Founders, Foundation/Legal and Partners/Advisors.   
    - __20%__ reserved for Founders/Foundation/Legal are locked for six months and released over two years. __50,492,160 POA__

    - __70%__ reserved for the token sale, all tokens were sold during presale in 58 seconds. __176,722,560 POA__  

#### Current circulating supply
The circulating supply of POA can be calculated by using the formula below. You can also check out the total circulating supply by going to the [Total POA](https://poaexplorer.com/tools/totalpoa) API endpoint.
    - __252,460,800 POA__ minus __20%__ (6 Month Lock) is equal to __201,968,640 POA__
    - __201,968,640 POA__ plus __SUM__ of __Number of Current Blocks__  

#### After the core launch
POA has a block time of __~5__ seconds and rewards each validated block miner __1 POA__ for each block. These block rewards never run out and in __November__ of __2018__ there will be __5 POA__ minted per block. The remaining __4 POA__ per block will be put aside to benefit the network however the current Validators vote to choose and Validator's reward will remain at __1 POA__.
