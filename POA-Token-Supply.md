## Initial Supply
POA's initial token supply when Core network was launched was __252,460,800 POA__. As you can see from the chart on the right, only __70%__ of POA was reserved for presale and the rest were reserved for Founders, Foundation/Legal and Partners/Advisors.   

- __20%__ or __50,492,160 POA__ reserved for Founders/Foundation/Legal are locked for six months and released over two years. 
- __10%__ or __25,246,080 POA__ reserved for Partners and Advisors of POA Network. 
- __70%__ or __176,722,560 POA__ reserved for the token sale, all tokens were sold during presale in 58 seconds.  

## Current circulating supply
The circulating supply of POA can be calculated by using the formula below. You can also check out the total circulating supply by going to the [Total POA](https://poaexplorer.com/tools/totalpoa) API endpoint.  

- __252,460,800 POA__ minus __20%__ (6 Month Lock) is equal to __201,968,640 POA__
- __201,968,640 POA__ plus __SUM__ of __Number of Current Blocks__  

## After the core launch
POA has a block time of __~5__ seconds and rewards each validated block miner __1 POA__ for each block. These block rewards never run out and on `November 17, 2018` there will be __2 POA__ minted per block. The remaining __1 POA__ per block will be put aside to benefit the network however the current Validators vote to choose, some example use cases are to Burn coins, hold coins or spend on R&D for the POA Foundation. Validator's reward will remain at __1 POA__ after this transition.
