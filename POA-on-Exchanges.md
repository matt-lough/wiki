**What is POA20?**  
   POA20 is an ERC20 representation of POA native tokens on Ethereum network. The POA20 token displays the exact same properties as the standard ERC20 token and allows it to be used in all the same places that offer ERC20 compatibility.

  POA20 tokens allow two standalone blockchains to safely and securely interact with each other through cross-chain bridges. It’s a critical step towards solving the scalability and connectivity issues and opens up a whole new avenue of solutions and use cases.
