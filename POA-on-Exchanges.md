__*Attention*__

Due to the nature of the agreements and NDAs, we really canâ€™t talk or even hint at what exchanges POA will be listed on, or when they will be listed. As soon as we can announce the exchanges, we will do so in all our social channels so everyone can find out at the same time.

Only information that can be released about exchanges is that the Inception Stage that POA Network is currently on, will end with an exchange listing. If you would like to know more about the Inception Stage, please read [POA Network Inception](https://medium.com/oracles-network/poa-network-day-1-poa-network-inception-188e5688ea98) official Medium post. 

- __Will POA be on EtherDelta exchange?__    
  No, POA is not an ERC20 token and will __NOT__ be listed on ED at the end of Inception stage. Any POA currently on ED is either a scam or another token with same ticker, please do your own due-diligence before investing in any token.
