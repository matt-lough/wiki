## Overview:

A Validator is an independent individual who stakes their identity and is entrusted to maintain a node on the network that validates transactions and commits new blocks to the blockchain.   Validators receive a reward in POA token for provisioning blocks.  

## Responsibilites:

A Validator has both technical and social responsiblities both of which are important for the health, performance and security of the network.  
### Technical Responsibilities:
* Ensure node is secure by practicing safe key management
* Maintain node requisite software version
* Monitor node to ensure its availablility and participation in consensus
* Monitor network in general and communicate with other Validators, network entities if problems arise.

   Governance is a collection of DApps where ballots are proposed and voted on by existing Validators to manage 
   the network. The Ballot types include:
   * Adding new Validators
   * Removing Validators, i.e. for compromising security of network, malicious behavior, non-participation in 
     Governance
