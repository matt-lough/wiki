## What is a Validator's Role
Validators on POA Network are the known people who validate the blocks. Proof of Authority means that they stake their identity to secure the network. Their identity is subject to a number of verification requirements, including proof of address and no criminal record.

### Built-in Governance
Validators vote for adding or removing validators using Governance DApp. Thus, the network supports voting at the consensus level.

## What is a Validator

The POA Network is a Proof of Authority consensus based on AuRa protocol, which relies on a well known set of Validators that are responsible for committing new blocks in the blockchain.  The Validators participate in the consensus protocol by broadcasting votes which contain cryptographic signatures signed by each Validator’s  private key.   

In POA Network, Validators stake their identity and reputation to participate on the network and currently must hold a valid notary license in their state of residence.  Although a Validator is not acting as a notary on the network,  it allows POA Network to leverage the current public trust model and any thirdparty can verify a Validator using public records.   This model levels the playing field so indeed anyone can participate compared to other models using Proof of Stake or Delegated Proof of Stake where high valued individuals, consortiums can dominate participate in the network.

POA Network will be bootstrapped with 12 Validators and grow to a set of 25 Validators in the near future.  The longer term goal is to support 50 or more Validators on the core network.  Additionally, POA Network supports horizontal scaling through cross-chain bridging whereby the need for Validators will grow as communities and/or government entities create their own POA Network.

Validators earn POAs as for block provisions through the execution of the AuRa PoA consensus protocol.  The amount of POA is based on the emission rate of the network, currently 2.5%.  If a Validator doubles signs, are frequently offline or does not participate in governance of the network they can be removed from the POA Network by the other Validators via a ballot and voting process.

To summarize, a Validator has both technical responsibilities, running and maintaining an POA Network node instance, as well as social responsibilities, participating in governance of the network and cultivating awareness and the proper skill set to maintain the security and health of the POA Network.

Further details concerning Validators can be found on the Validator FAQ here (<TBD>).

## # Becoming a Validator

<Are we still on hold for new Validators?>
If you are interested in becoming a Validator and hold a public notary license, you can declare your interest in being a validator by posting to Validator forum here ( https://forum.poa.network/c/notaries-intro ).   Please include a picture, a short background, your interest/motivation in POA Network and links ( LinkedIn, GitHub etc … ).

If you do not currently hold a notary license you can still declare your desire to be a Validator on the forum here ( https://forum.poa.network/t/on-hold-apply-for-a-license-to-create-blocks-in-oracles-network/14/18 ).   Additionally, you will need to acquire your notary license and update your Validator profile to be considered for participation on any POA Network.

It is strongly encouraged to participate on the forums by asking questions and reviewing documentation to familiarize yourself with the processes and skill sets required to fulfill your role as a Validator.  Also, there are none Validator entities called bootnodes that help stabilize and secure the network.  Running a bootnode is an excellent way to support the POA Network Ecosystem and highlight your interest and willingness to participate as a Validator.

Baseline recommendations:

Read the Validator FAQ
Be familiar with all the responsibilities of being a Validator by reading the FAQ here (<TBD> ).   The FAQ will be frequently updated so be sure to check in often.

Participate

Join the POA Forum and stay up to date with the news and events occuring on the Network.  Ask questions, review documentation and consider running a bootnode on the testnet or on the core network.

Key Management 

It is mission critical that an attacker cannot steal a Validator’s key. If this is possible, it puts the entire network at risk.   <TBD -- Need to add some guidelines for key management here>
