Solution:

- Organize the HF on block 772,000

## Instructions

_**NOTE: **_ If you have already done a HF upgrade you can navigate to your 

1. poa-devops directory
2. Update repository:
> git pull

3. Verify your config is correct below.
### Verify Config

* **In  `group_vars/all`:
* for validator:
```
poa_role: "validator"
MAIN_REPO_FETCH: "poanetwork"
GENESIS_BRANCH: "core"
```

* for bootnode hoster:
```
poa_role: "bootnode"
MAIN_REPO_FETCH: "poanetwork"
GENESIS_BRANCH: "core"
```

* for master of ceremony:
```
poa_role: "moc"
MAIN_REPO_FETCH: "poanetwork"
GENESIS_BRANCH: "core"
```

* for explorer
```
poa_role: "explorer"
MAIN_REPO_FETCH: "poanetwork"
GENESIS_BRANCH: "core"
```

* **On step 3** ("create hosts file") please double-check that you're using IP address of your **CORE** node in `hosts` file.

4. ( only if you've done step 3 above ) Execute the playbook
> ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml


If not:

1.  Follow instructions from here to replace `spec.json` on your node:
https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-devops/blob/master/docs/Spec-hardfork.md

2.  Verify Config in (3.) above

3.  Execute the playbook
> ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml


### Update Verification

After scripts successfully runs:

- ssh into node
- cd /home/validator or /home/bootnode
- execute command:
> grep -n -A2 772000  spec.json

Should see:

>             "772000 ": {
>              "safeContract": "0x83451c8bc04d4ee9745ccc58edfab88037bc48cc"
>             }
