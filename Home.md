# POA Network Wiki

POA Network is the first Ethereum-based public network with Proof of Authority consensus, reached by independent validators. We are building a public network for smart contracts that combines speed, security, and cost efficiency. We see POA Network as a first step towards realizing our vision of horizontal blockchains scalability by creating a swarm of blockchains with Proof of Authority consensus, connected by interledger protocols.

__POA Network is NOT an ERC20 token, but is ERC20 Compatiable. POA has its own blockchain, networks and is the first of its kind. The network is a working progress, features and additions will be added/completed in a timely manner. If you are having any issues with any of POA services, please create a Github Issue in the `wiki` repository, thank you.__
