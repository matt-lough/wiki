## How to setup a bootnode on not-AWS.
__*Attention*__
All commands to configure and deploy node to POA Networks are done on your local Machine/Virtual Machine. For non-AWS & non-Azure nodes, you MUST create/configure your Remote Virtual Machine's user privileges and SSH key before running `site.yml` script.

0. make sure you have Python 2 (versions 2.6 or 2.7) or Python 3 (versions 3.5 and higher) installed on your local machine (Windows isn't supported for the control machine) and Ansible v2.3+

1. setup an Ubuntu 16.04 server

2. to run playbook you will need a user on the server, who can execute `sudo` wihout password and who can be logged in via SSH public key. By default it is assumed that this user is called `ubuntu`. If you already have a user with different name who satisfies these requirements, at the top of `site.yml` in `-hosts: all` section change line `user: ubuntu` to the name you have
```
---
- hosts: all
  user: another-user
  become: True
...
```
_NOTE_: playbook will additionally create a new unprivileged user named `bootnode` and add your ssh public key to `root` account.

3. clone repository with ansible playbooks and checkout branch with the network name you want to join (e.g. `core` for mainnet and `sokol` for testnet)

```
git clone https://github.com/poanetwork/deployment-playbooks.git
cd deployment-playbooks
# for core mainnet
git checkout core
# OR for sokol testnet
git checkout sokol
# check that you ended up on a correct branch (look where the `*` is)
git branch
```

4. put ssh public keys (in format "ssh AAA...") that need access to the server to both files
```
files/admins.pub
files/ssh_bootnode.pub
```
(one key per line)

5. create configuration file
```
cat group_vars/all.network group_vars/bootnode.example > group_vars/all
```

6. edit the `group_vars/all` file and comment out parameters corresponding to aws:
```
#access_key
#secret_key
#awskeypair_name
#vpc_subnet_id
```

7. set values given to you by Master of Ceremony for the following parameters in `group_vars/all`:
* `NODE_FULLNAME`
* `NODE_ADMIN_EMAIL`
* `NETSTATS_SERVER`
* `NETSTATS_SECRET`

8. set the following options as follows:
```
allow_bootnode_ssh: true
allow_bootnode_p2p: true
allow_bootnode_rpc: false
associate_bootnode_elastic_ip: false
```
_Double check that_ `allow_bootnode_ssh` _is_ `true` _otherwise you won't be able to connect to the node_.

9. create file `hosts` with the server's ip address (e.g. 192.0.2.1):
```
[bootnode]
192.0.2.1
```

10. run ansible playbook
```
ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml
```

11. open `NETSTATS_SERVER` url in the browser and check that the node named `NODE_FULLNAME` appeared in the list

12. login to the node and get enode from parity logs:
```
ssh root@192.0.2.1
grep enode /home/bootnode/logs/parity.log
```
copy `enode` uri and send it to Master of Ceremony. If this line is not found, restart parity
```
systemctl restart poa-parity
```
and try again. If `enode` uri is still not found, use the commands below to restart all services.

_NOTE_ if after parity restart you notice that on `NETSTATS_SERVER` url your node starts to fall behind other nodes (block number is less than on other nodes), try to restart statistics service (assuming you are connected as `root`):
```
su bootnode
pm2 restart all
```
after that refresh `NETSTATS_SERVER` url and check again your node's block number. If your node is still not active or missing `enode`, log in to root account and reboot the OS. 
```
su 
shutdown -r now
```
