### Connect to POA Networks using TrustWallet
Our partner TrustWallet already comes with the POA network loaded in its list of networks.

1. __Creating / Importing your wallet__

If this is your first time opening TrustWallet, the first screen will present you with two options for either generating a new a wallet or importing one you already have. Clicking on Import Wallet will present a screen where you put in your private key.

2. __Changing the network__

To change the network, click on the Settings icon , and then on the first item, Network. There you will see a list of networks, including POA Network. Selecting that, will change your network to the POA network and if you had imported the same address used to purchasing POA you should see your tokens there now.
