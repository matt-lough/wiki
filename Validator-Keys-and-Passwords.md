## Introduction

The first responsibilities of a Validator is understanding the process of becoming a Validator and the singular importance of the securing your Validator keys and their passwords.  A key is equivalent to having an account on the POA Network.

From:  http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/account-management.html
> "Every account is defined by a pair of keys, a private key and public key. Accounts are indexed by their address which is derived from the public key by taking the last 20 bytes. Every private key/address pair is encoded in a keyfile. Keyfiles are JSON text files which you can open and view in any text editor. The critical component of the keyfile, your accountâ€™s private key, is always encrypted, and it is encrypted with the password you enter when you create the account."  ...

> Creating a key is tantamount to creating an account ...You can be certain that without your key and your PASSWORD, nobody else can ever access it

To participate on the POA Network one needs (3) keys, (2) of which are required 

* Mining key -- required, account used to validate and create blocks, account also receives reward for block creation
* Voting key -- required, account used to participate in Governance
* Payout key -- optional, account used to receive rewards from mining account as a security mechanism
