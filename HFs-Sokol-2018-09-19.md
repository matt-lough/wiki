## Description
### Problems
- Governance smart contracts are non-upgradable.
- Feature request: we need to increase emission supply for self-sustainability of the network ([poanetwork/RFC#14](https://github.com/poanetwork/RFC/issues/14)).
- Feature request: there is no ability to create one ballot for three keys ([poanetwork/poa-network-consensus-contracts#92](https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-network-consensus-contracts/issues/92)).
- Feature request: there is no ability to finalize ballot earlier if all validators voted before the end of a ballot ([poanetwork/RFC#8](https://github.com/poanetwork/RFC/issues/8)).
- DApp performance: There are no tuple getters in smart contracts. It leads to the low performance of `Voting DApp`.
- `pragma solidity ^0.4.18;` used for governance smart contracts is outdated.
- Smart contracts need to be refactored in order to make them easy to read.
- Smart contracts need to be checked for security and design issues.
- Minor bugs.

### Solution
1. Deploy new smart contracts and migrate all the data from old to new contracts with [`scripts/migrate/migrateAll.js`](https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-network-consensus-contracts/blob/6c2c7798394ed14abcfb53fe9ce6269cd83630ff/scripts/migrate/migrateAll.js).
2. Update [`poa-chain-spec/contracts.json`](https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-chain-spec/blob/sokol/contracts.json).
3. Update [`poa-chain-spec/abis`](https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-chain-spec/tree/sokol/abis).
4. Update [`poa-chain-spec/spec.json`](https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-chain-spec/blob/sokol/spec.json):
- add an address of the new `PoaNetworkConsensus` contract to `engine/authorityRound/params/validators/multi`;
- add `blockRewardContractAddress` (obtained from step 1) and `blockRewardContractTransition` (equal to `4639000`) to `engine/authorityRound/params`.
5. Organize the HF on block `4622420`.

### Increased Emission Supply

In the scope of this hard fork, the emission supply will be increased by 1 POA per block.

POA has a block time of __~5__ seconds and rewards each validated block miner __1 POA__ for each block. These block rewards never run out and after the hard fork there will be __2 POA__ minted per block. The remaining __1 POA__ per block will be put aside to benefit the network however the current Validators vote to choose, some example use cases are to Burn coins, hold coins or spend on R&D for the POA Foundation. Validator's reward will remain at __1 POA__ after this transition.

## Instructions

You should follow this instruction to replace `spec.json` on your node:
https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-devops/blob/master/docs/Spec-hardfork.md

* on STEP 2 (create group_vars/all...) use the following parameters:
```
MAIN_REPO_FETCH: "poanetwork"
GENESIS_BRANCH: "sokol"
```

* on STEP 3 (create/edit hosts file...) please double-check that you're using your `SOKOL` node's IP address

* on STEP 6 (connect to the node...) after you've done all the checks, also verify HF block number:
```
grep -n -A2 4622420 spec.json
```
You should see:
```
>             "4622420": {
>                 "safeContract": "0x03048F666359CFD3C74a1A5b9a97848BF71d5038"
>             }

```
