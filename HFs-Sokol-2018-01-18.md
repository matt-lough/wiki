- Organize the HF on block 509355

## Instructions
Follow instructions from here to replace `spec.json` on your node:
https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-devops/blob/master/docs/Spec-hardfork.md

* **On step 2** ("create group_vars/all file") set the following values for parameters in  `group_vars/all`:
* for validator:
```
poa_role: "validator"
MAIN_REPO_FETCH: "poanetwork"
GENESIS_BRANCH: "sokol"
```

* for bootnode hoster:
```
poa_role: "bootnode"
MAIN_REPO_FETCH: "poanetwork"
GENESIS_BRANCH: "sokol"
```

* for master of ceremony:
```
poa_role: "moc"
MAIN_REPO_FETCH: "poanetwork"
GENESIS_BRANCH: "sokol"
```

* for explorer
```
poa_role: "explorer"
MAIN_REPO_FETCH: "poanetwork"
GENESIS_BRANCH: "sokol"
```

* **On step 3** ("create hosts file") please double-check that you're using IP address of your **SOKOL** node in `hosts` file.

### Update Verification

After scripts successfully runs:

- ssh into node
- cd /home/validator or /home/bootnode
- execute command:
> grep -n -A2 509355

Verify "safeContract:" 0x[need new contract address]
